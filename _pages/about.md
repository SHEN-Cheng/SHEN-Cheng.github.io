👨🏻‍💻 I'm a PhD student working on the near-surface wind speed change at Regional Climate Group [(RCG)](http://rcg.gvc.gu.se/) in University Gothenburg, supervised by Prof [Deliang Chen](http://rcg.gvc.gu.se/dc/).   

🔬 My research interests are wind speed change and wind energy, my work aims to find the potential causes to changes in wind speed and wind extreme events, using a combination of observationas, reanalysis and simulation models.

📽️ Collaborations are welcome.

## Climate change impacts on wind power generation
![Europe’s electricity generation from wind blown off course](/images/wind.jpg){: .align-right width="350px"} 
Less wind has a direct impact on the amount of electricity that can be generated by the many wind farms at globe. If the global stilling continues to happen will have a massive impact on alternative energy production. Turbines are somewhat inefficient, with limits on how much energy they can extract from the wind. According to some research, a 10 percent decline in wind speeds would actually result in “a 30 percent drop, and that would be catastrophic.”

## Eastern Asian Subtropical Jet contributed to the hiatus of March surface wind over China
![EASJ](/images/FigureS6.jpg){: .align-right width="300px"} 
A general decrease (stilling) that ceased around 2011, followed by a general significant increasing tendency (reversal) in all months but March over China. Indeed, March's wind series after 2011 showed a pause (i.e., hiatus) from the 1979–2011 slowdown. This hiatus was mainly caused by the general wind reduction across northern China since 2011, which differs from the wind increase observed in other regions. The slowdown in March from 2011 to 2020 is related to the southward shift of East Asian subtropical jet streams, which are fast‐flowing, narrow, and meandering air currents in the upper atmosphere (a). Jet streams play an important role in shaping both upper and lower air circulation and influence surface wind by transporting high and low‐pressure systems.

# Selected Experience


## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal. \
(🤫 Recently, I have submitted a second one.)

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I work on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content.
