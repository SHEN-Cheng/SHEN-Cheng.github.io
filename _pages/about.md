👨🏻‍💻 I'm a PhD student working on the near-surface wind speed change at Regional Climate Group [(RCG)](http://rcg.gvc.gu.se/) in University Gothenburg, supervised by Prof [Deliang Chen](http://rcg.gvc.gu.se/dc/).   

🔬 My research interests are wind speed change and wind energy, my work aims to find the potential causes to changes in wind speed and wind extreme events, using a combination of observationas, reanalysis and simulation models.

📽️ Collaborations are welcome.

## Climate change impacts on wind power generation

Less wind has a direct impact on the amount of electricity that can be generated by the many wind farms at globe. If the global stilling continues to happen will have a massive impact on alternative energy production. Turbines are somewhat inefficient, with limits on how much energy they can extract from the wind. According to some research, a 10 percent decline in wind speeds would actually result in “a 30 percent drop, and that would be catastrophic.”

## Increases of offshore wind potential in a warming world
![EASJ](/images/offshore_wind_energy.jpg){: .align-right width="340px"} 
Offshore wind farms, a rapidly expanding sector within wind energy, are playing a significant role in achieving global carbon neutrality, and this trend is to continue. Here, we utilize ERA5 reanalysis to correct offshore wind speed trends predicted by CMIP6 models. This approach led to enhanced projections for changes in offshore Wind Power Density (WPD) under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) scenarios. Throughout the 21st century, global offshore WPD is projected to follow an upward trend across all SSP scenarios. Notably, Europe stands out with the most substantial increase in offshore WPD among regions with higher current installations, projected to reach up to 26% under 4°C global warming. Our study uncovers a notable increase of global offshore WPD in a warmer climate, which offers valuable insights for the strategic planning of future global wind energy.

# Selected Experience


## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal. \
(🤫 Recently, I have submitted a second one.)

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I work on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content.
